# USELESS TOMMY ROBO üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: TIME PASS


### Team Members
- Team Lead: BEN PHILIP - MAR BASELIOS CHRISTIAN COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY PEERMADE
- Member 2: ABIN ABRAHAM - MAR BASELIOS CHRISTIAN COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY PEERMADE

### Project Description
This project showcases TOMMY, a simple and expressive robot face built using ESP32, an OLED display, and a servo motor to simulate eye-blinking and nodding motions.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world full of cold, lifeless robots, who will nod in agreement to your brilliant ideas or give you a blank stare that somehow feels judgmental?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing TOMMY ‚Äì a desk buddy with no real job, no wheels, and zero productivity...
But wow, does it have expressions.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used

 Hardware:
- ESP 32 DEV MODULE
- SERVO MOTOR
- OLED DISPLAY 

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
1)Install the Arduino IDE.

2)Install the following libraries via Library Manager:

3)Adafruit SSD1306

4)Adafruit GFX

5)ESP32Servo (if using ESP32)


# Run
1)Open the .ino file in Arduino IDE.

2)Select your board (e.g. ESP32 Dev Module) and COM port.

3)Connect your components as per the wiring below.
